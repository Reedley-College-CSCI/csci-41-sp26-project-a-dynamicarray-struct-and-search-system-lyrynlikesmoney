Summary:
The idea is a food menu. The records would be the variety of foods on the menu. The food items will have prices, prices with a side dish, calories, and short descriptions. 
I believe the sarch feture is the majority of how this would be useful. It should allow for additions to the menu and quick searches.

Files:
menu.txt: a text file including the dataset ant its records/fields
menu.cpp: the main program that does all the heavy lifting

How to use: 
Make sure menu.txt is in the same folder and run program. Adding or removing is done through the text file. 
I'm still figuring out the search thing, so for now it can only look specifically for the word that is inputed.
